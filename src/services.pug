            p Sileta knows very well the challenge of juggling several commitments with limited resources. This is a challenge Sileta accepted very early and dedicated effort in mastering as a skill. We have distilled this skill into a Software System which reduces commitments into Cases.<br><br>This Case Management System (CMS) allows a Manager or Entrepreneur to delegate issues or cases online. The CMS allows for each case the definition of the following: Priority, Due Date, Responsible Person, and Classification of such case into several configurable categories such as Marketing, Operations, and Finance.<br><br>Moreover, the system allows for Clients to e-mail requests which the system handles through providing necessary feedback – while internally, management can then use the system to either delegate such a request to an internal or external resource.<br><br>As personnel continuously update their activities in resolving a case – appropriate information is automatically reflected on the Client side thereby reducing Client frustration by keeping him or her informed thereby streamlining Entrepreneurs’ limited resources.
